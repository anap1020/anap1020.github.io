	<div align="center" > <h2>Why I Love this palette!</h2> </div>
	<div> <p>I fell In love since the first moment I saw the palette on Instagram in the official account @kyliecosmetics because the package looks really cool and minimalist also the colors where awesome and it has a good brush. I was looking for that shades because they are in trend and it matches with my color of eyes. I have to say that I also like Kylie´s work so It was something perfect, the formula is really good and the shades are pigmented, specially peachy and mojito (my favs) Peachy is a bold, medium-dark orange with a hint of red, which mutes the color a bit, paired with a matte finish. The eyeshadow felt dusty in the pan, but it did not result in noticeable fallout when I was applying it to the lid, as the color adhered well to bare skin. It had good color payoff with a soft, blendable consistency. Mojito is a bright, golden chartreuse green with a metallic finish. It leaned more golden than it did green. It had rich, opaque color coverage, this palette it´s really easy to use and finally it's not really expensive. I will add a video of a tutorial with other photos. </p> <a href="http://www.allure.com/story/kylie-cosmetics-royal-peach-palette"> click for more info</a> </div>
